## Termiology

SMS: System management stack

MPI: Message Passing Interface
PMI: Process Management Interface <- part of MPICH(in detail PMI-1 is implemented in MPD)
PMIx: PMI Exascale

RTE: Run-Time Environment

Hybrid (e.g. MPI+OpenMP) programming

## Container Comparison

Kurtzer, Gregory & Sochat, Vanessa & Bauer, Michael. (2017). Singularity: Scientific containers for mobility of compute. PLoS ONE. 12. 10.1371/journal.pone.0177459. 

Docker is well designed for micro-virtual service
HPC centers can't install it and provide irreasonable service.

HPC center have to keep secure, compatible environment.


Singularity **extreme portability**
